# Small-scale-Solar-System-model
First try at Implementation of three.js library


To start this project I had to go an start from scrach reading the documentation for Three.js a 3d Javascript library.

After a couple of hours I was able to render some geometries and control the camera in a basic way.

As now the project include all the planet in the solar system and the rotation are calculated based on a mathematical operation that use earth rotation as a base.
